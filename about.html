            <p>I am a self-taught amateur photographer based in Boise, Idaho. I began shooting sunsets at the age of 10 and I am still inspired by them. I have a BS in Psychology from Brigham Young University. I was also a missionary in Finland, which is where the name “Sisu” comes from. Sisu is a synonym for “grit,” a trait that all Finns possess. I like to think many of my photos reflect that trait too.</p>
            <p>Though primarily interested in landscape and nature photography, I turned to action photography as a way to be engaged in my husband’s and children’s activities. Sports photography is challenging, but when you capture that one great shot that reflects all the elements of what’s transpiring, it’s very motivating.</p>
            <p>I enjoy capturing the beauties and details of my travels. I’ve also worked on the river, photographing white water kayaking and rafting. I’ve done a lot of volunteer photography for my kids sports teams, church events, and family reunions. And though I’m not very interested in portraiture (that would be my son), I do enjoy taking candid photos.</p>
            <p>As much as I enjoy grandeur, I also appreciate the small details. I am fascinated with pattern, texture, color, and extremes in lighting. It often takes going to extremes (early mornings, late nights, and lots of hikes), patience, and a little bit of luck to get that perfect shot. Many favorite photos were just a matter of being in the right place at the right time—nature is not very predictable. I have also missed some amazing moments because I was in the moment, and all thoughts of the camera were gone.  That’s important too. It’s like the scene in Walter Mitty: “If I like a moment, for me, personally, I don’t like to have the distraction of the camera. I just want to stay in it.”</p>
            <p>Thank you for letting me share my photos with you. </p>
